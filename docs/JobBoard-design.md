## Brand & Style
The design system embodies "Grown, Not Manufactured"—a philosophy where the platform feels cultivated with care rather than assembled from a generic template. It serves two audiences at once, employers and jobseekers, who need to trust the same interface with very different stakes: headcount on one side, income on the other.

The visual style is **Fresh Minimalism**. It takes its cues from nature—new growth, open air, morning light—without ever collapsing into "everything is green." Key principles include:
- **A Dominant Hue, Not a Monochrome:** Mint carries the brand, but it is set within a proper color scheme rather than repeated at different opacities.
- **Warmth over Sterility:** Rounded geometry and a warm neutral base keep the product from reading as cold, generic SaaS.
- **Clarity First:** Friendly never means vague—hierarchy and contrast must make the next action obvious to both a hiring manager and a first-time jobseeker alike.

## Colors
The palette is built on **color theory, not vibes**: mint sits at roughly 155° on the wheel, so its secondary is pulled from a split-complementary position (~15°, warm coral) rather than a true complement, giving contrast and energy without visual clash. The result follows a 60/30/10 balance—60% warm neutral, 30% mint, 10% coral—so mint reads as dominant without becoming monotonous.

- **Primary (Mint):** The brand's main voice—primary actions, active nav, links. Carries roughly 30% of any given screen.
- **Secondary (Coral):** A split-complementary accent used sparingly (~10%) for the single most important action or highlight on a screen—this is what keeps the palette from reading as "all green."
- **Accent (Sky):** An analogous cool hue near mint on the wheel, used for informational states, messaging, and secondary data series—it stays inside the same "fresh air" family instead of introducing a fourth unrelated hue.
- **Backgrounds (Warm Ivory):** Never pure white—an ivory base with a faint warm-green undertone keeps long dashboard sessions comfortable and ties neutrals back to the primary hue.
- **Surfaces (Sage/Stone):** Low-contrast, slightly cooler-neutral containers used for cards and dividers to separate content without adding visual noise.

## Typography
The typographic hierarchy relies on the pairing of a rounded, friendly **Poppins** for display type and a highly legible, neutral **Inter** for everything functional.

- **Headlines:** Use Poppins Semibold for marketing headlines, page titles, and card/section titles alike—one weight, used consistently, keeps dense dashboard screens feeling connected to the marketing site rather than like a different product.
- **Body:** Use Inter for all functional copy, forms, and tables. Its neutrality keeps mint, coral, and sky doing the work of expressing brand—not the typeface.
- **Labels:** Use "Label-Caps" for filter chips, status tags, and eyebrows. Tracking is moderate (0.08em)—enough to feel intentional without tipping into stiff or formal.
- **Alignment:** Left-align by default, including most hero sections—this is a working tool people return to, not an editorial spread. Reserve centered text for narrow empty-states and confirmations.

## Layout & Spacing
The layout philosophy is a **12-column grid** tuned for two different modes: a calmer marketing surface and a denser working dashboard.

- **Grid:** 1280px max container, with 64px desktop margins on marketing pages; in-app dashboard views may pull margins in to fit more working content.
- **Vertical Rhythm:** 96px gap between major marketing sections—enough room to feel calm without the slow, editorial pacing of a luxury brand. Dashboard modules use a tighter, consistent 24px gutter.
- **Responsive Behavior:** On mobile, margins reduce to 20px and section gaps compress to 48px. Sidebar navigation collapses to icon-only on tablet and to a bottom bar or drawer on mobile; multi-column stat cards stack to a single column.

## Elevation & Depth
Depth is achieved through **soft tonal layers plus gentle, warm-tinted shadows**—enough lift to feel tactile and friendly, never harsh.

- **Surfaces:** Use shifts in warm neutral value (e.g., a Sage container on an Ivory background) to indicate hierarchy before reaching for shadow.
- **Borders:** When needed, thin (1px), low-contrast lines (Outline-Variant) frame inputs and low-emphasis cards alongside soft shadow, not instead of it.
- **Shadows:** Cards and popovers use diffused, warm-tinted ambient shadows; modals use a stronger shadow plus a scrim, so focused tasks are unmistakably separated from the page behind them.

## Shapes
The shape language is **Soft & Rounded (8–24px)**.

To reflect the ease and approachability of nature rather than architecture, all UI elements—buttons, inputs, cards, and images—use a consistent rounded scale: 8px for inputs and small controls, 12–16px for cards and modals, up to 24px for large hero media, and fully rounded (pill) for chips, tags, and toggles. Never mix a sharp corner into this system—consistency in roundness is what reads as considered rather than accidental.

## Components
- **Buttons:** Primary buttons are solid Mint with white text. Secondary/emphasis buttons use Coral, reserved for the one most important action on a screen. All buttons use the "Button" typography role, pill or 8px radius, no letter-spacing.
- **Inputs:** Full-width boxes with a 1px Outline-Variant border, 8px radius, and a soft Surface-Container-Low fill—never stark white. Labels sit above in plain-case Body-Md; focus state uses a Mint-tinted border and subtle glow.
- **Cards:** No hard shadows—use a Sage/Surface-Container fill plus a soft ambient shadow, with generous internal padding (min 24px, 32px for stat cards). Status icons rotate through Mint, Coral, and Sky containers so metrics don't blur into one color.
- **Chips/Filters:** Use "Label-Caps" typography, pill radius. Active states are solid Mint with white text; inactive states are Surface-Container fill with On-Surface-Variant text.
- **Images:** Real, warm photography of people at work, never cold stock offices. Use a soft dark scrim under overlaid text and a consistent large radius or full-bleed edge.
- **Navigation:** A persistent left sidebar (collapsible to icon-only) with the active item shown as a solid Mint pill, collapsing to a bottom tab bar or drawer on mobile so wayfinding stays obvious for infrequent jobseeker-side visits.
